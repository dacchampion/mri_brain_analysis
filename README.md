# rmi_brain_analysis
Project for the Mathematical modelling of Biomedical images

Analytics and modelling of RMI data from pre-term and non pre-term subjects in order to detect significant differences
leading to future complications or further pathologies given this condition.

The project is structured in the following way:

1. Experimental routines help discovering important correlations between noisy signals and the goodness of fit
2. Load data, are just a set of functions helping out reading raw files in their components
3. Mathematical modelling contains a set of source code files with experiments using single, two and three compartments
   models, in addition to simpler models like linear regression and multi-linear regression models.
4. MCMC testing contains routines to estimate the models' parameters confidence interval
5. Model evaluation, contains routines to quantitatively choose a model based on their complexity and accuracy

In addition it can be found the report for this project with the name **DiegoCamacho_1710573_FinalReport.pdf**

__The data for this project is private so is not delevered with this repository__
